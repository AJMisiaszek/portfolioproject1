<LI><b>Computer Literacy: </b>Computer Literacy is one's ability to navigate a computer's functions. Computer literacy correlates strongly with exposure. Consequently older generations tends to have a lower computer literacy. Conversely, many young people who have been raised with comoutere access are very computer literate.</LI><br>
<LI><b>Information Integrity: </b>The booming access to computers and the rise of social media has given billions the ability to publish information at their leisure. Many mistakenly use this access to share information which they believe to be true but is ultimately misleading. Others seek to decieve and manipulate, and thus spread information that is false knowingly. To ensure information integrity is to confirm that information that has been shared is reliable. This can be done by considering the source of the information. For example an online encyclopedia has a higher informantion integrity than your average twitter comment. </LI>

<LI><b>Portable Computers: </b>As computer technology porgresses, processing power has become easier to concentrate into a small volume. Put more technically, processing units have become smaller and more efficacious. This means that it is less burdensome to manufacture and own a relatively high-power machine. Computers have therefore become very accessible, and our society has grown to rely heavily on their ready access. Many of us not keep  on our person a more powerful computer than NASA had during the Apollo 11 Mission. Laptop computers are a popular form of portable computer, as well as smartphones and smartwatches.</LI><br>
<LI><b>Networks: </b>A network of devices is a group of devices that communicate between oneanother.
    Today, the world possesses such an elaborate networking system that we can contact people from
    around the world at any moment.  </LI>
    <br>
<LI><b>Computer Literacy: </b>A key player in the appeal of the internet is the search engine. These are online tools 
which allow users to search a term, and be presented with a list of relevant online resutlts. This is an extremely 
    appealing convenience. It is becoming increasingly rare for people to rely on more antiquated ways of looking up information. </LI>
